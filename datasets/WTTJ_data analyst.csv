2024-01-10T15:46:24Z,CDI,Data Product Owner H/F,"Au sein du Health Data Hub, l’équipe produit a pour objectif de définir le cap pour le développement de la plateforme technologique, mais également la mise à disposition d’outils de données pour faciliter la découverte, l’ingestion et la valorisation des données de santé manipulées sur cette plateforme. Dédié à ce deuxième objectif, le rôle du Data Product Owner au Health Data Hub est une position stratégique pour le développement de l’écosystème des données de santé en France et en Europe. Ce poste exige une collaboration étroite non seulement avec le Product Owner Plateforme et le Product Manager, mais aussi avec une équipe diversifiée incluant des développeurs, la direction des données, la direction technique, et d’autres parties prenantes clés. En tant que Data Product Owner, vous serez plongé dans un environnement technologique de pointe, utilisant des outils tels que Kubernetes, Python, Node et React. Vous serez chargé de projets cruciaux tels que le développement d’un  Catalogue de Métadonnées , une application prévue pour le déploiement au sein du Health Data Hub et auprès de ses partenaires. Ce projet ambitieux a pour objectif de se transformer en un catalogue national ,  alimentant un catalogue européen de données de santé . Le catalogue de métadonnées est mis à disposition des chercheurs pour les orienter vers les bases de données d’intérêt avant la mise à disposition effective de celles-ci dans la plateforme. Cela permet d’anticiper dans un contexte où la mise à disposition des données requiert des démarches réglementaires pouvant s’inscrire dans un délai long. Ce catalogue doit pouvoir être renseigné simplement, maintenu et donner la granularité d’information suffisante sans mettre en risque la confidentialité des données. Il doit pouvoir être redéployé en marque blanche pour les partenaires et autres organismes de santé qui souhaiteraient s’en saisir et pouvoir se connecter à d’autres, pour faciliter la découverte des données à l’échelle européenne. Aussi, votre rôle consistera à superviser  la mise en place d’une solution de validation de qualité des données . L’étape d’ingestion des données au sein du HDH est très méticuleuse. Il faut tout d’abord pseudonymiser certaines informations par des méthodes de masquage avant de les intégrer en espace d’ingestion. Lors de ce processus, la donnée peut être détériorée. L’ambition est alors d’avoir un processus qui valide la qualité de ces données à chaque étape de l’ingestion, évaluant à chaque fois l a qualité, l’intégrité et la confidentialité de ces données  avant de les mettre à disposition dans le serveur pour la recherche. Votre mission sera d’assurer que les données de santé, provenant de sources publiques et privées,  soient non seulement accessibles mais aussi utilisées efficacement pour favoriser l’innovation médicale et la recherche.  Vous jouerez un rôle essentiel dans les phases de  Discovery et de Delivery des projets,  en mettant l’accent sur les éléments les plus importants de notre infrastructure. Parmi vos responsabilités,  la création et la gestion d’un backlog  efficace et la contribution à la vision globale du produit seront primordiales. Vous ferez  le pont entre les besoins métiers et les solutions techniques , en élaborant des stratégies de collecte d’informations, y compris des interviews d’utilisateurs (internes et externes), pour garantir que nos solutions répondent aux exigences des utilisateurs finaux. En tant que Data Product Owner, vous incarnerez la vision du produit au sein de l’écosystème du Health Data Hub, en assurant l’alignement entre les différentes directions et en relevant les défis liés à la sécurité des données sensibles. Vous serez également un acteur clé dans l’industrialisation des processus de développement et des opérations, contribuant à l’accélération de l’adoption de cette plateforme à l’échelle nationale et facilitant l’intégration avec d’autres plateformes et services.

Comment leur proposer les meilleurs traitements sur le long cours ? Comment appuyer les professionnels de santé dans un contexte clinique qui se complexifie ou en cas de crise sanitaire ? L’Intelligence Artificielle et les données de santé font partie de la réponse.  Elles sont incontournables pour la recherche et l’innovation en santé. Par exemple, pour prévenir des insuffisances cardiaques à partir de données issues d’appareils connectés, ou pour accélérer le dépistage du cancer du sein à partir d’analyses automatiques des examens de mammographies. Ou même pour réunir assez d’informations afin d’améliorer la prise en charge des maladies rares. Et pour ça, la France a la chance de disposer de bases de données extrêmement riches !  Mais ces données sont souvent sous exploitées car dispersées. Grâce à des solutions innovantes telles que l’IA, l’objectif du Health Data Hub est justement de permettre d’accéder de manière facilitée; unifiée, transparente et sécurisée à un catalogue de bases de données de santé françaises. Comment ? Le Health Data Hub a mis en place une plateforme technologique qui met à disposition des porteurs de projets d’intérêt public, dans un environnement technologique sécurisé et à l’état de l’art, les données de santé pseudonymisées des français. Ces porteurs de projets vont mobiliser des sources de données très volumineuses, les croiser entre elles, et utiliser une puissance de calcul pour faire tourner des algorithmes de recherche complexes. Il s’agit par exemple de projets de start-up pour améliorer des logiciels d’aide au professionnel de santé, de projets permettant d’améliorer la prise en charge des patients en comparant l’efficacité de prise en charge, de projets portés par les administrations pour éclairer les politiques publiques. Notre offre technologique, en constante évolution, peut être consultée ici. Les défis sont de taille pour traiter ces données de santé sensibles, volumineuses de natures et formats variables. La plateforme doit être un levier d’innovation dans l’écosystème de la donnée de santé français. En résumé, avec le Hub, nous accompagnons des porteurs de projets innovants qui contribuent à trouver les solutions de demain pour améliorer la santé de tous les citoyens.",Paris,2024-01-10T16:18:44Z

Comment leur proposer les meilleurs traitements sur le long cours ? Comment appuyer les professionnels de santé dans un contexte clinique qui se complexifie ou en cas de crise sanitaire ? L’Intelligence Artificielle et les données de santé font partie de la réponse.  Elles sont incontournables pour la recherche et l’innovation en santé. Par exemple, pour prévenir des insuffisances cardiaques à partir de données issues d’appareils connectés, ou pour accélérer le dépistage du cancer du sein à partir d’analyses automatiques des examens de mammographies. Ou même pour réunir assez d’informations afin d’améliorer la prise en charge des maladies rares. Et pour ça, la France a la chance de disposer de bases de données extrêmement riches !  Mais ces données sont souvent sous exploitées car dispersées. Grâce à des solutions innovantes telles que l’IA, l’objectif du Health Data Hub est justement de permettre d’accéder de manière facilitée; unifiée, transparente et sécurisée à un catalogue de bases de données de santé françaises. Comment ? Le Health Data Hub a mis en place une plateforme technologique qui met à disposition des porteurs de projets d’intérêt public, dans un environnement technologique sécurisé et à l’état de l’art, les données de santé pseudonymisées des français. Ces porteurs de projets vont mobiliser des sources de données très volumineuses, les croiser entre elles, et utiliser une puissance de calcul pour faire tourner des algorithmes de recherche complexes. Il s’agit par exemple de projets de start-up pour améliorer des logiciels d’aide au professionnel de santé, de projets permettant d’améliorer la prise en charge des patients en comparant l’efficacité de prise en charge, de projets portés par les administrations pour éclairer les politiques publiques. Notre offre technologique, en constante évolution, peut être consultée ici. Les défis sont de taille pour traiter ces données de santé sensibles, volumineuses de natures et formats variables. La plateforme doit être un levier d’innovation dans l’écosystème de la donnée de santé français. En résumé, avec le Hub, nous accompagnons des porteurs de projets innovants qui contribuent à trouver les solutions de demain pour améliorer la santé de tous les citoyens.",Paris,2024-01-04T10:38:33Z

Comment leur proposer les meilleurs traitements sur le long cours ? Comment appuyer les professionnels de santé dans un contexte clinique qui se complexifie ou en cas de crise sanitaire ? L’Intelligence Artificielle et les données de santé font partie de la réponse.  Elles sont incontournables pour la recherche et l’innovation en santé. Par exemple, pour prévenir des insuffisances cardiaques à partir de données issues d’appareils connectés, ou pour accélérer le dépistage du cancer du sein à partir d’analyses automatiques des examens de mammographies. Ou même pour réunir assez d’informations afin d’améliorer la prise en charge des maladies rares. Et pour ça, la France a la chance de disposer de bases de données extrêmement riches !  Mais ces données sont souvent sous exploitées car dispersées. Grâce à des solutions innovantes telles que l’IA, l’objectif du Health Data Hub est justement de permettre d’accéder de manière facilitée; unifiée, transparente et sécurisée à un catalogue de bases de données de santé françaises. Comment ? Le Health Data Hub a mis en place une plateforme technologique qui met à disposition des porteurs de projets d’intérêt public, dans un environnement technologique sécurisé et à l’état de l’art, les données de santé pseudonymisées des français. Ces porteurs de projets vont mobiliser des sources de données très volumineuses, les croiser entre elles, et utiliser une puissance de calcul pour faire tourner des algorithmes de recherche complexes. Il s’agit par exemple de projets de start-up pour améliorer des logiciels d’aide au professionnel de santé, de projets permettant d’améliorer la prise en charge des patients en comparant l’efficacité de prise en charge, de projets portés par les administrations pour éclairer les politiques publiques. Notre offre technologique, en constante évolution, peut être consultée ici. Les défis sont de taille pour traiter ces données de santé sensibles, volumineuses de natures et formats variables. La plateforme doit être un levier d’innovation dans l’écosystème de la donnée de santé français. En résumé, avec le Hub, nous accompagnons des porteurs de projets innovants qui contribuent à trouver les solutions de demain pour améliorer la santé de tous les citoyens.",Paris,2024-01-04T16:16:20Z

Comment leur proposer les meilleurs traitements sur le long cours ? Comment appuyer les professionnels de santé dans un contexte clinique qui se complexifie ou en cas de crise sanitaire ? L’Intelligence Artificielle et les données de santé font partie de la réponse.  Elles sont incontournables pour la recherche et l’innovation en santé. Par exemple, pour prévenir des insuffisances cardiaques à partir de données issues d’appareils connectés, ou pour accélérer le dépistage du cancer du sein à partir d’analyses automatiques des examens de mammographies. Ou même pour réunir assez d’informations afin d’améliorer la prise en charge des maladies rares. Et pour ça, la France a la chance de disposer de bases de données extrêmement riches !  Mais ces données sont souvent sous exploitées car dispersées. Grâce à des solutions innovantes telles que l’IA, l’objectif du Health Data Hub est justement de permettre d’accéder de manière facilitée; unifiée, transparente et sécurisée à un catalogue de bases de données de santé françaises. Comment ? Le Health Data Hub a mis en place une plateforme technologique qui met à disposition des porteurs de projets d’intérêt public, dans un environnement technologique sécurisé et à l’état de l’art, les données de santé pseudonymisées des français. Ces porteurs de projets vont mobiliser des sources de données très volumineuses, les croiser entre elles, et utiliser une puissance de calcul pour faire tourner des algorithmes de recherche complexes. Il s’agit par exemple de projets de start-up pour améliorer des logiciels d’aide au professionnel de santé, de projets permettant d’améliorer la prise en charge des patients en comparant l’efficacité de prise en charge, de projets portés par les administrations pour éclairer les politiques publiques. Notre offre technologique, en constante évolution, peut être consultée ici. Les défis sont de taille pour traiter ces données de santé sensibles, volumineuses de natures et formats variables. La plateforme doit être un levier d’innovation dans l’écosystème de la donnée de santé français. En résumé, avec le Hub, nous accompagnons des porteurs de projets innovants qui contribuent à trouver les solutions de demain pour améliorer la santé de tous les citoyens.",Paris,2024-01-04T09:59:20Z

Nous recherchons un/e candidat/e pour un stage applicatif portant sur la structuration du savoir-faire nécessaire à l'évaluation de l'empreinte environnementale de moteurs d'avion, sur leur cycle de vie. L'objectif est de construire une base robuste pour le pilotage des futures évaluations environnementales qui permettront d'accomplir une démarche structurée pour les différents projets d'écoconception de la Société. Safran Aircraft Engines met en œuvre une logique d'évaluation environnementale de ses produits à différents niveaux : moteur complet, pièce et matériaux & procédés, en s'appuyant notamment sur la méthode d'Analyse de Cycle de Vie (ACV). Le savoir-faire qui se dégage des analyses passées et en cours nécessite d'être capitalisé et mis à disposition de manière efficace pour les futures études environnementales qui viendront alimenter les démarches d'écoconception dans les bureaux d'études. Le stage se déroulera dans le Département d'Ingénierie Environnement Produits, au sein du Pôle Projets Ecoconception. Il s'articulera sur des phases d'état des lieux, structuration méthodologique et capitalisation, puis mise en place d'une approche de dissémination. Les principaux travaux consisteront en : - L'analyse des études réalisées au sein de l'entreprise et leur classification selon des caractéristiques clés à définir (objectif, périmètre…). - L'identification des éléments constitutifs pouvant faire l'objet d'une réutilisation pour des études ultérieures, notamment diagrammes de processus, modèles réalisés sous logiciel ACV… - La structuration d'une bibliothèque / base de données permettant l'accès aux différentes données ainsi identifiées, en tenant compte de l'ergonomie de l'accès aux connaissances selon les besoins des potentiels utilisateurs. - La mise à disposition de la bibliothèque auprès des utilisateurs.

2023-12-04T14:01:02Z,Stage,Biostatistician : Heterogeneous treatment effects    Overview of biostatistical/Machine Learning methods and their implementation  (internship) ,"Context It is well-known that treatment effects may not be homogeneous across the study population [1]. This has led to the development of numerous algorithms aimed at exploring how treatment effects can differ among subgroups in a clinical setting [2]. Moreover, even though subgroup analysis are performed on a regular basis in confirmatory (Phase III) clinical trials, there remains a potential for unobserved heterogeneity. This particularly holds true in the experimental setting where the number of enrolled patients remains limited. The increasing access to RWD derived from patient care facilitates the generation of evidence, thereby informing clinical decisions tailored to specific patient subgroups. Consequently, there is growing opportunity to identify significant heterogeneity of treatment effects within these subgroups in a RW setting [3,4]. Over the past ten years, ML techniques have been increasingly developed for identifying subgroups that exhibit varying treatment effects [5]. Given the potential of ML, investigating algorithms that can further elucidate patient subgroups, and potentially individualized responses, is of particular interest.  Objectives The master’s student is expected to: Perform an up-to-date methodological literature review to identify relevant biostatistical and ML approaches for investigating treatment effect variability in RW settings;  Based on the findings from the literature review, identify potential strengths and limitations of these methods as regards specific clinical contexts;  Implement a selection subset of the identified methods on to RWD;  Write a manuscript intended for submission to an international peer-reviewed journal.

2023-12-04T14:01:06Z,Stage,Biostatistician : Surrogacy Evaluation in Real-World Settings (internship),"Context In recent years, regulatory authorities have increasingly approved drugs and biologics on the basis of surrogate endpoints [1]. As defined by the US FDA, “a surrogate endpoint is a clinical trial endpoint used as a substitute for a direct measure of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. A surrogate endpoint does not measure the clinical benefit of primary interest in and of itself, but rather is expected to predict that clinical benefit” [2]. However, the identification, evaluation, and validation of surrogate endpoints remains challenging, though many statistical methods have become available, most of them framed within the causal-inference and meta-analytic paradigms [3-9].  While the concept of surrogacy has traditionally been approached from a clinical trial perspective, the increasing interest in real-world evidence, e.g. from a regulatory/HTA perspective, could make its use relevant in this situation. For instance, leveraging short-term surrogates in real-world data could guide policymakers evaluating new treatments. Also, it could be used to leverage data, such as Electronic Health Records or registry data, to better inform the design of shorter and cheaper clinical trials through surrogate marker validation. Han et al. have recently proposed novel inverse probability weighted and doubly robust estimators for surrogacy evaluation in the real-world setting, i.e. when treatment is not randomly assigned, illustrating the increasing focus on this specific topic [10].  Objectives The master’s student is expected to: Become competent in the surrogacy concept and evaluation (in clinical trials);  Conduct an up-to-date methodological literature review to identify examples of surrogacy evaluation in the real-world setting;  Upon literature review conclusions, identify potential pros and cons of each methods;  Apply identified methods of interest to real-world data;  Write a manuscript with the aim to be submitted in an international peer-reviewed journal.

Comment leur proposer les meilleurs traitements sur le long cours ? Comment appuyer les professionnels de santé dans un contexte clinique qui se complexifie ou en cas de crise sanitaire ? L’Intelligence Artificielle et les données de santé font partie de la réponse.  Elles sont incontournables pour la recherche et l’innovation en santé. Par exemple, pour prévenir des insuffisances cardiaques à partir de données issues d’appareils connectés, ou pour accélérer le dépistage du cancer du sein à partir d’analyses automatiques des examens de mammographies. Ou même pour réunir assez d’informations afin d’améliorer la prise en charge des maladies rares. Et pour ça, la France a la chance de disposer de bases de données extrêmement riches !  Mais ces données sont souvent sous exploitées car dispersées. Grâce à des solutions innovantes telles que l’IA, l’objectif du Health Data Hub est justement de permettre d’accéder de manière facilitée; unifiée, transparente et sécurisée à un catalogue de bases de données de santé françaises. Comment ? Le Health Data Hub a mis en place une plateforme technologique qui met à disposition des porteurs de projets d’intérêt public, dans un environnement technologique sécurisé et à l’état de l’art, les données de santé pseudonymisées des français. Ces porteurs de projets vont mobiliser des sources de données très volumineuses, les croiser entre elles, et utiliser une puissance de calcul pour faire tourner des algorithmes de recherche complexes. Il s’agit par exemple de projets de start-up pour améliorer des logiciels d’aide au professionnel de santé, de projets permettant d’améliorer la prise en charge des patients en comparant l’efficacité de prise en charge, de projets portés par les administrations pour éclairer les politiques publiques. Notre offre technologique, en constante évolution, peut être consultée ici. Les défis sont de taille pour traiter ces données de santé sensibles, volumineuses de natures et formats variables. La plateforme doit être un levier d’innovation dans l’écosystème de la donnée de santé français. En résumé, avec le Hub, nous accompagnons des porteurs de projets innovants qui contribuent à trouver les solutions de demain pour améliorer la santé de tous les citoyens.",Paris,2024-01-10T13:15:15Z
